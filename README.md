# Project Overview

Project Name: JAGS by Example

Goals:

* To provide a set of example analyses using R and JAGS illustrating bayesian
  data analyses
* Implement the examples using R Markdown


**Warning:** I am using this project as an opportunity to consolidate my
own understanding of JAGS and Bayesian data analysis. 
This project is under active development, and includes many draft analyses some
of which contain errors and problems.
When it is ready for general consumption, I'll make a blog post.
But at the moment, it is user beware.
